Suggested structure after brief discussion with Paul on Wednesday.
Not sure if it's worth adopting the parton+vertex structure, might
make the code harder to read. Will have to play around a bit more,
but before that we should discuss if we want a structure with all
final partons either in the beginning or the end of the vector.
