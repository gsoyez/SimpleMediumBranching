Suggested structure after brief discussion with Paul on Wednesday.
Not sure if it's worth adopting the parton+vertex structure, might
make the code harder to read. Will have to play around a bit more,
but before that we should discuss if we want a structure with all
final partons either in the beginning or the end of the vector.

-------------------------

- fix/check the tabs!

- this-> can be removed [C++ is not Pythion] is on by default

- ctor initialisation: prefer
    Vertex() : index_parent(-1){}
  over
    Vertex(){index_parent = -1;}

- class and member functions comment
  Doxy comments in headers, normal comments in source files
 
- rename getN

- remove useless headers in event.cc

- move Branching::* into Generator

- Generate -> Generator

- Generator returns ref to Event, same for get... in Event

- getXYZ() -> XYZ()

- leave a space in the comments
